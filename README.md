  ## API
  We used the [Spotify API](https://rapidapi.com/Glavier/api/spotify23) to find music and artists.
  This API provided access to a wide range of music-related data including tracks, albums, artists, playlists and more.

  ## MVP Features
  - **Search Bar**: Implement a search bar to search for tracks, artists or albums.
  - **Multiple Pages**: Develop multiple pages including home, search, library, podcasts and discover pages.
  - **Ability to play songs**: Allow users to play songs directly within the application.
 
    ## Basic User Story
    - As a user, I want to see a home page that gives me access to the search page, my library, my profile, and new music.
- As a user, I want to have a search page where I can search for a track, an artist, or an album.
- As a user, I want to have a library page where I can see my liked songs and albums.
- As a user, I want to see information about my profile on a separate page.
- As a user, I want to have a page where I can simply browse and discover new music.

  ## Expected Challenges
- Utilizing the vast amount of data available from the Spotify API effectively.
- Designing aesthetically pleasing pages for all sections of the application.
- Ensuring smooth and seamless user interaction and experience throughout the application.
